description: Learn how to augment your existing infrastructure with an event hub that facilitates the exchange of messages/events between devices, (micro) services and applications. Go beyond the traditional request-response paradigm and its limitations. Streams uses event-driven APIs such as server-sent events (SSE) and Webhooks to help you adopt event-driven integration patterns with your ecosystem.
