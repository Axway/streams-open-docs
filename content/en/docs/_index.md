Axway Streams documentation is available for collaboration using an open source model as part of the Axway Open Documentation Open Beta program.

## About the Open Beta program

The Open Beta enables you to suggest edits and create issues for any page of the documentation using a GitHub account. To learn more, see the [contribution guidelines](/docs/contribution_guidelines/).

The role of each documentation website in the Open Beta is as follows:

* Axway Open Documentation on Netlify (<https://axway-open-docs.netlify.app/>) - Specific product documentation sets are available on this website for contribution using GitHub and Netlify CMS.
* Axway Documentation Portal (<https://docs.axway.com/>) - All Axway documentation is available on this website in read-only format.

All contributions are first published on Axway Open Documentation, and shortly after on the Axway Documentation Portal, so that the latest documentation is always available on both websites.

## Axway Streams documentation

This website contains the documentation set for Streams.

Browse all documentation for Streams under the top-level [Streams](/docs/streams/) item in the left navigation menu.
