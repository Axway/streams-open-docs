description: Learn how to augment your existing infrastructure with an event hub that facilitates the exchange of messages and events between devices, microservices, and applications. Go beyond the traditional request-response paradigm and its limitations. Streams uses event-driven APIs, such as server-sent events (SSE) and Webhooks, to help you adopt event-driven integration patterns with your ecosystem.

## Contribute to Axway Streams documentation

The Open Beta enables you to suggest edits and create issues for any page of the documentation using a GitHub account. To learn more, see the [contribution guidelines](/docs/contribution_guidelines/).

The role of each documentation website in the Open Beta is as follows:

* Axway Open Documentation on Netlify (<https://axway-open-docs.netlify.app/>) - Specific product documentation sets are available on this website for contribution using GitHub and Netlify CMS.
* Axway Documentation Portal (<https://docs.axway.com/>) - All Axway documentation is available on this website in read-only format.

All contributions are first published on Axway Open Documentation, and shortly after on the Axway Documentation Portal, so that the latest documentation is always available on both websites.

This website contains the documentation set for Streams.
