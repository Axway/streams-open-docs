# Axway-Open-Docs

Amplifystreams-Open-Docs is a docs-as-code implementation for Amplify Streams documentation. It is built using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator with the [Google Docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy) theme. The site is deployed on Netlify at <https://amplifystreams-open-docs.netlify.app/>. Users can edit any documentation page using GitHub web UI or a WYSIWYG editor provided by [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/).

This repository contains all files for building and deploying the site. The Markdown files for the documentation are stored at `/content/en/docs`.
